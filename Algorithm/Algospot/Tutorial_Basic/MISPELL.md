## Subject: Mispell
## Content: Misspelling is an art form that students seem to excel at. Write a program that removes the nth character from an input string.
## Input: 
##   The first line of input contains a single integer N, (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000) which is the number of datasets that follow.
##   Each dataset consists of a single line of input containing M, a space, and a single word made up of uppercase letters only. 
##   M will be less than or equal to the length of the word. The length of the word is guaranteed to be less than or equal to 80.
## Output: 
##   For each dataset, you should generate one line of output with the following values: 
##   The dataset number as a decimal integer (start counting at one), a space, and the misspelled word. 
##   The misspelled word is the input word with the indicated character deleted.
